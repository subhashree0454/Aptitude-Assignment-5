Here are the solutions to your questions:

### 1. A's Work Completion Time

Let the total work be \( W \).

- A does \(\frac{4}{5}W\) in \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the time it takes B to do the same work.
- Let B's time to complete the whole work be \( T_B \). Then, A's time \( T_A = \frac{3}{5} T_B\).

From the information given:
\[
\frac{4}{5}W = \text{(Rate of A)} \times \frac{3}{5} T_B \implies \text{Rate of A} = \frac{4W}{3T_B}
\]
\[
\text{Rate of B} = \frac{W}{T_B}
\]

Since they together finish the work in 12 days:
\[
\text{Rate of A} + \text{Rate of B} = \frac{W}{12}
\]
Substituting the rates:
\[
\frac{4W}{3T_B} + \frac{W}{T_B} = \frac{W}{12}
\]
Multiplying through by \(12T_B\):
\[
48 + 12 = T_B \implies T_B = 60 \text{ days}
\]
Then, A's time:
\[
T_A = \frac{3}{5} \times 60 = 36 \text{ days}
\]

**Answer:** A alone will complete the work in **36 days**.

### 2. Work Completion by 10 Men and 5 Women

Let the work rates be:
- Rate of 1 man = \(M\)
- Rate of 1 woman = \(W\)
- Rate of 1 child = \(C\)

From the first scenario:
\[
M + 3W + 4C = \frac{1}{96}
\]

From the second scenario:
\[
2M + 8C = \frac{1}{80} \implies M + 4C = \frac{1}{160}
\]

From the third scenario:
\[
2M + 3W = \frac{1}{120} \implies M + \frac{3}{2}W = \frac{1}{240}
\]

Now, solving these equations:

1. From \(M + 4C = \frac{1}{160}\), substitute \(M\):
   \[
   M = \frac{1}{160} - 4C
   \]
2. Substitute into \(M + 3W = \frac{1}{240}\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{160} - 4C + 3W = \frac{1}{240}
   \]
   After solving this, you can express \(C\) and \(W\) in terms of \(M\) and find a relation.

Finally, sum the rates for 10 men and 5 women:
\[
10M + 5W = 10 \left(\frac{1}{160} - 4C\right) + 5W
\]
Calculate \(C\) using previous relations and find the total time taken.

**Final answer will be:** Time for 10 men and 5 women to complete the work.

### 3. Percentage Increase in Revenue Collection

Let the original ticket price be \( P \) and the original sales be \( S \).

The increase in sales:
\[
\text{New Sales} = S \times \left(1 + \frac{57 \frac{1}{7}}{100}\right) = S \times \frac{8}{5}
\]

The increase in price:
\[
\text{New Price} = P \times \left(1 + \frac{16 \frac{2}{3}}{100}\right) = P \times \frac{5}{3}
\]

The new revenue:
\[
\text{New Revenue} = \text{New Sales} \times \text{New Price} = S \times \frac{8}{5} \times P \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{8SP}{3}
\]

The original revenue:
\[
\text{Original Revenue} = SP
\]

So the increase in revenue:
\[
\frac{\frac{8SP}{3} - SP}{SP} = \frac{8/3 - 1}{1} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 166.67\%
\]

**Answer:** Revenue collection increases by **166.67%**.

### 4. Remaining Food for Soldiers

Initial food supply:
\[
\text{Total Food} = 1600 \text{ soldiers} \times 60 \text{ days} \times 900 \text{ grams} = 86400000 \text{ grams}
\]

Food consumed in 40 days by 1600 soldiers:
\[
\text{Food Consumed} = 1600 \times 40 \times 900 = 57600000 \text{ grams}
\]

Remaining food:
\[
\text{Remaining Food} = 86400000 - 57600000 = 28800000 \text{ grams}
\]

Now, 400 soldiers leave:
\[
\text{Remaining Soldiers} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Daily consumption for 1200 soldiers:
\[
\text{Daily Consumption} = 1200 \times 1000 = 1200000 \text{ grams}
\]

Days the remaining food will last:
\[
\text{Days} = \frac{28800000}{1200000} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

**Answer:** Food will last for **24 days**.

### 5. Cost Price of the Bicycle

Let the cost price of the bicycle be \( CP \).

Selling price with 10% profit:
\[
SP = CP + 0.1CP = 1.1CP
\]

If bought at 10% less:
\[
CP' = CP - 0.1CP = 0.9CP
\]
Selling price with 25% profit:
\[
SP' = CP' + 0.25CP' = 1.25 \times 0.9CP = 1.125CP
\]

From the problem:
\[
1.125CP = 1.1CP + 60 \implies 0.025CP = 60 \implies CP = \frac{60}{0.025} = 2400
\]

**Answer:** The cost price of the bicycle is **Rs. 2400**.
